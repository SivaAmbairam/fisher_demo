To do so, student groups each examine 1 of 5 unique scenarios that include family pedigrees. They also explore how a disease can be caused by genetic changes in many different genes and can be inherited in a dominant, recessive, or X-linked pattern. Featuring reusable case cards and decals, this kit is perfect for teaching pedigrees and inheritance within an authentic, engaging medical context. Product Features Kit materials are sufficient for 10 groups of 3 to 4 students. Kit activities are designed for a single 90-minute class period or two 45-minute periods. Materials are fully reusable.

Biotechnology,New - Biotechnology,214828,How Do Polygenic Risk Scores Stack Up? Kit,1,Call For Pricing,https://www.carolina.com/human-genetics/how-do-polygenic-risk-scores-stack-up-kit/214828.pr,https://www.carolina.com/images/product/large/214828.jpg,"Product Details A unique experience that teaches both graphing literacy and genetics The How Do Polygenic Risk Scores Stack Up? Kit uses authentic data and graphical representations to address 2 central questions: How are traits, such as disease risk, distributed across a population? And how can identifying an individual's risk shape health care decision-making? Recent advances have led to models that combine the impact of genetic risk factors for an individual developing a particular disease into a single calculation known as a polygenic risk score (PRS). To help students understand how these models can affect health decisions, the activity employs 3-dimensional boxes to represent normal and skewed population curves, giving learners a visually impactful hands-on experience with the data. Students use these curves to examine polygenic risk scores and assess a person's risk for 2 different complex diseases. In addition to teaching essential data and graphing skills, the activity also highlights a weakness in current genomic research—lack of diversity—with the hope of equipping the next generation of researchers, health care workers, and consumers to address this critical issue. Product Features Designed for a class of 30 students and easily adaptable to larger classes. Includes 30 unique boxes that stack and rotate to show 4 distinct data distributions. Boxes are foldable for easy storage. Visually impactful examples of normal and skewed distributions. Discusses the need for diversity in current genomic research. Time Requirements One 90-minute block period or two 45-minute periods. Learning Objectives Analyze data on traits within a population to identify patterns within expressed traits. Construct a model of trait distribution across a population and analyze data to determine where an individual lies within that distribution. Discuss how relative diversity within a population sample can impact the clinical utility of an individual's polygenic risk score. Classify a distribution graph as ""normal"" or ""skewed."" Given a data set, build models that illustrate distribution across a population. Explain what a polygenic risk score is and use it to assess an individual's genetic risk of developing a complex disease. Describe the limitations of polygenic risk scores."

Or a morning lark? The answer may be in your genes. This lab allows students to test their own genotypes at the circadian clock gene Per3 locus that has been associated with sleep behavior preferences in humans. The coding region of this gene contains a VNTR (variable number tandem repeat) that is polymorphic (variable) across people. In one study, a Per3 allele carrying 4 copies of this repeat was found at higher frequencies in people with a preference for evening activity, while the allele with 5 copies of this repeat was found more frequently in individuals with a preference for morning activities. Students will get to assess their own Per3 genotypes using PCR and gel electrophoresis, while also assessing their sleep phenotypes by answering a questionnaire about their own chronotypes (circadian preferences). As is true for many postulated genetic associations, the evidence for a link between Per3 genotypes and sleep phenotypes is not yet definitive—while some studies have shown association between this VNTR and sleep, others were unable to reproduce it. Your work is needed! We hope that collective data gathered in your classroom can help shed light on this possible association between Per3 genotypes and circadian phenotypes. You'll participate in an authentic open inquiry investigation on the genetic underpinnings of sleep.

Antibodies are an important protein of the immune system; they recognize and bind to antigens, triggering a variety of immune responses that protect the cell from infection. Modular in design, they are composed of 2 heavy chains and 2 light chains. Each heavy chain is composed of 4 immunoglobulin folds. Each immunoglobulin fold consists of 2 flat beta sheets held together by a covalent disulfide bond between 2 cysteine amino acids, found in one of the beta sheets. Each light chain consists of 2 immunoglobulin folds. The antigen binding site is located at the ends of these Y-shaped proteins, where immunoglobulin folds from each chain come together. Antibodies are difficult to study because they are so flexible. However, in the 1960s, Rodney Porter and Gerald Edelman independently determined the structure of the antibody using different techniques. They shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. On the plastic 8-1/2"" antibody model, the heavy chains are yellow, the light chains are red, and the carbohydrate is blue, which stabilizes the heavy chains in the molecule. On the nylon 3-1/2"" antigen model, the heavy chains are white, the light chains are red, and the carbohydrate is blue. Models should be handled with care.

Perform a successful bacterial transformation! Using β-thalassemia as a medical example, students explore the phenomenon of gene regulation in this hands-on kit. As students progress through the lab, they consider why changes in the DNA sequence in front of a gene (not in the gene's coding sequence) affect how much functional protein is produced by the gene. They also use a new plasmid in a transformation experiment that includes a gene for kanamycin resistance. They learn to utilize IPTG as a compound to turn on gene expression for certain promoters. Finally, students successfully transform plasmid to produce green fluorescent protein (GFP). Kit includes enough materials for a class of 32 students working in 8 groups of 4, as well as 1-year access to digital resources that support 3-dimensional instruction for NGSS.

This comparative laboratory exercise can be taught using either a guided or an inquiry activity. In the guided activity, students measure the pH of a citric acid solution titrated with a strong base and plot the titration curve. Students repeat the procedure with a solution prepared from a commercial lemonade mix, which behaves as a buffer and whose primary ingredient is citric acid. Students compare the 2 titration curves, make observations, and address the differences in the curves. The inquiry activity allows students to design a procedure to evaluate a commercial lemonade mix's buffering capacity. It also provides an opportunity for students to present their experimental design and results, reinforcing the practice of communicating findings. Detailed preparation and procedure notes guide the teacher through leading a successful inquiry activity, including a suggested rubric for assessing student performance. Both activities include assessment questions that follow the AP® Chemistry Exam free-response question format. In the assessment, students predict how changes in acid concentration and the acid-to-conjugate base ratio affect a titration curve's shape. Students understand that changes in acid concentration and conjugate base increase a solution's buffering capacity, while changes in the acid-to-conjugate base ratio determine a solution's pH. This kit provides the following AP® Chemistry experiences: design a procedure to collect data, analyze data, make predictions about chemical changes, perform a titration, use a pH meter and a buret, and plot a titration curve.

Teach this laboratory experience using either the guided or inquiry activity. In the guided activity, students determine the specific heat capacity of a calorimeter then use the calorimeter to determine the molar enthalpy of solution of calcium chloride and ammonium chloride. Students perform multiple trials and observe that different masses of salt generate different temperature changes while the molar enthalpy of solution remains constant. In the inquiry activity, students design either a hot pack or cold pack using the 2 chloride salts. The inquiry activity provides an opportunity for students to present their experiment design and results, reinforcing the practice of communicating findings. Detailed preparation and procedure notes guide the teacher through leading a successful inquiry exercise, including a suggested rubric for assessing student performance. Both activities include assessment questions that follow the format of the AP® Chemistry Exam free-response questions. In the assessment, students use provided data to determine the molar enthalpy of neutralization. Students write and balance chemical equations, determine the limiting reactant, and determine whether the process is endo- or exothermic. Students also consider how changes in quantities of reactants affect the magnitude of the reaction's temperature change and its molar enthalpy of reaction. Provides the following AP® Chemistry experiences: design a procedure to collect data, analyze data, graph data, perform error analysis, calculate percent error, write and balance chemical equations, identify limiting reactants in reactions, and perform multiple trials. The use of calcium chloride and ammonium chloride makes this procedure safer than traditional procedures that use nitrate salts. Materials are sufficient for 30 students in teams of 3.

And the entire program adheres to the Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS), America's newest framework for science learning. Offer an Affordable Dissection Alternative Schools benefit from providing a hands-on alternative for students who want to opt out of dissection. VR dissection also can be used as a supplemental learning platform. Pacing is user-controlled to ensure maximum understanding as you progress through the program. Wendy Martin covers each of the pig's systems while posing questions along the way to check for understanding.
